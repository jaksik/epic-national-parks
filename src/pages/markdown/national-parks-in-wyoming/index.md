Wyoming is home to two incredible national parks which are by far the best places to visit in Wyoming. One of the national parks, Yellowstone, has been Wyoming's clame to fame for over a century and is actually the oldest national park in the entire world, being established back in 1872. Just south of Yellowstone is Wyoming's 2nd national park, Grand Teton.

Both of the national parks in Wyoming are located in the upper north west corner of the state and are most easily accessed by driving from Idaho or flying into the ski town of Jackson. Considdering the harsh winters of Wyoming, the best time to visit both Yellowstone and Grand Teton national park is early fall, that way you can avoid the massive summer crowds and hopefully catch a glimpse of the breath taking fall foilage before the snow begins to fall.

## What are the national parks in Wyoming?
The national parks in Wyoming are towering mountains, wild herds of roaming bison, and of course vast geyser fields. Road trips to the Wyoming national parks have been life changing experiences for explorers of all ages for over a century now. 

Wyomings national parks are extremely popular and best experienced when a bit of planning is involved. The summer months always attract large crowds and lodging is quickly booked up.

### 1. Yellowstone National Park

Yellowstone National Park was the first officially established national park in the entire world, being founded back in 1872, it has no doubt paved the way for environmental conservation around the globe. Being home to the largest geyser fields in the world as well as the largest remaining wild buffalo heard, it truly has lots to offer that can't be found anywhere else.

Being larger that the states of Rhode Island and Delaware combined, most people plan on spending at least 3 days at Yellowstone National Park to be sure to see everything that they want to see. The geyser, Old Faithful, which is named after the predictability of its eruptions, is the most famous part of Yellowstone.

### 2. Grand Teton National Park

Grand Teton National Park is home to the majestic Teton Range which dramatically rises above the surrounding landscape. The park is nestled in northwestern Wyoming just less than an hour south of Yellowstone, near Jackson. With over 200 miles of trails, this parks is any hiker's paradise. 

If your up for the challenge, Grand Teton National Park is great place for snow shoeing in the winter. Easily accessible from the tiny ski town of Jackson, snow shoeing will give you a unique perspective of the park experienced only by a fraction of the anual visitors.
