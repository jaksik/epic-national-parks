Being the largest state in the nation, it comes to no surprise that Alaska has 8 national parks that are full of the most jaw dropping landscapes on Earth, these are also the best places to visit in Alaska. What surprises most people is the mind blowing vast amounts of land that these parks cover. The size of Wrangell-St Elias National Park alone, is the size of Yellowstone National Park, Yosemite National Park, and Switzerland combined! 

To visit all of the national parks in Alaska you need to be prepared to put on your hiking boots, fly in a seaplane, and ride on a few boats because half of the national parks in Alaska don't even have roads leading to them because they are so remote.

## What are the national parks in Alaska?
The national parks in Alaska are tens of millions of acres of some of the most beautiful, pristine, and jaw dropping landscapes on Earth. They include vast wildernesses, hundreds of glaciers, islands, volcanoes, salmon runs, grizzly bears, and of the highest mountain in North America, Mount Denali.

Alaska's national parks are without a doubt the best places to visit in Alaska. They hold the epic and jaw dropping landscapes that we've always seen on the Discovery Channel and National Geographic. After a trip to these parks, you'll know why they call it "the last frontier".

One of the most exciting and dynamic national parks in the US, Glacier Bay National Park is an ever changing landscape that truly showcases the powerful forces of nature. Home to over 1,000 glaciers, the park is constantly changing and evolving as the glaciers slowly chizel away at the surrounding mountains. Nothing can compare to witnessing thousands of pounds of ice break off and smash into the sea.

Total travel time from Juneau to the Glacier Bay National Park visitor center at Bartlett Cove is about 5.5 hours. The only way to travel to Glacier Bay by car, is by taking a 4 hour ferry ride from Juneau to the small town of Gustavus and then driving to the Bartlett Cove visitor center, which is about a 20 minute drive.

### 2. Denali National Park and Preserve

Home to Mount Denali, the highest mountain in North America with a summit elevation of 20,146 feet, no one ever forgets their first time approaching the mountain as they gaze at its sheer size and mass. The mountain is so large and prominent that it can be seen all the way from Anchorage on a clear day which is 130 miles away as the crow flies. Although Mount Denali is one of <a href="http://www.alpineinstitute.com/programs/expeditions/the-seven-summits/">the 7 summits</a> and attracts hundreds of mountaineers every year, it is just as inspiring and important to the average tourist as well.

Travelling to Denali National Park by car or bus, which is about a 5 hour trip from Anchorage, is the quickest way to the park. However, many people opt-in to taking the train that way they can sit back and relax, although it is quite a bit more expensive.

With the Harding Icefield covering over 700 square miles and 40 glaciers flowing from it, Kenai Fjords National Park famously gives us a glimpse of what it may have been like to be alive during the ice age. In addition to this icy world, the park also features dramatic landscapes of lush forests, high mountains, and an abundance of wildlife.

Being just a 2.5 hour drive from Anchorage, Kenai Fjords National Park is the closest and most accessible national park to Anchorage. The visitor center is in Seward and is the best place to start your adventure.

There are so many grizzly bears in the park that the official national park website even says <a href="https://www.nps.gov/katm/planyourvisit/bear-encounters-in-katmai.htm">"you are almost guaranteed to have a bear encounter in many locations"</a>. However, there's alot more to the park than just grizzlies, sitting right on The Ring of Fire, Katmai also boasts 14 active volcanoes.

Getting to Katmai can be a bit difficult considdering that the park is almost exclusively accessed by just planes or boats. Most people choose to book their trip through a travel agency to avoid the headache of managing the logistics.

Wrangell-St. Elias is perhaps the most magnificent national park in the entire country, not just because of its sheer size, but because of the incredible jaw dropping landscapes that can be found throughout the park.
