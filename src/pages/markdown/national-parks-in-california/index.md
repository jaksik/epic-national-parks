## What are the national parks in California?

The California national parks are volcanoes, islands, forests, deserts, granite walls, and much more. They are full of record breaking natural features, including both the highest and lowest elevations in the continental US, the tallest trees in the world, and the largest plug dome volcano in the world.

To experience it all, you need to be prepared for road trips, boat rides, and of course a lot of hiking. While some of the parks are just a few hours drive outside of some of the major cities, others such as Channel Islands National Park is only accessible by a ferry.

Just a few hours east of Los Angeles, Joshua Tree National Park is the "escape to nature" for most Angelenos. It's also conviniently located just outside the town of Indio, which is home to the world famous Coechella music festival. Named after the famous Joshua Trees that thrive throughout the park, Joshua Tree National Park is one of the best places to visit in California.

Although most people make a day trip to Joshua Tree National Park, camping out and stargazing is perhaps one of the most memorable and inspiring experiences that one can have at Joshua Tree. The park is home to some of the most clear night skies in all of California and as you lie beneath the incredible Milky Way, you'll be able to count an infinit number of reasons to come back in the future.

Reaching an elevation as low as 282 feet below sea level, it's no surprise that Death Valley National Park is where the hottest temperature has ever been recorded on Earth. A scorching 134 Â°F was recorded here in Furnace Creek on July 10th, 1913. What is a surprise is that Death Valley National Parks is among one of the most visited national parks in the country with over 1.7 million visitors in 2019 alone. Perhaps the most mind boggling part is that Badwater Basin, the lowest part of the park, sits just 85 miles as the crow flies from the summit of Mt. Whitney, the highest point in the continental US.

Death Valley National Park is no joke, be sure to bring excessive amounts of water with you while hiking and even driving. The heat can sneak up on you and causes several heat strokes every year.

Sequoia trees are not the tallest, widest, or oldest trees on Earth, but they are with out a doubt massive, totally impressive, and the reason why Sequioa National Park is one of the best places to visit in California. With the tallest trees soaring to over 260 feet hight and 30 feet in diameter, if these trees don't inspire you, I'm not sure what will.

Just about 4 hours from both San Francisco and Los Angeles, Sequoia National Park attracts eplorers from all over the state and even the world. The entire norther border of the national park is the southern border of Kings Canyon National Park, so most visitors make a point of traveling to both parks in the same trip.

Lassen Volcanic National Park, sometimes reffered to as "Little Yellowstone", is full of steaming fumaroles, active volcanoes, and lava scorched landscapes. Your first visit to the park will likely remind you of the family road trip you took to Yellowstone National Park as a child.

Lassen Volcanic National Park boasts the largest plug dome volcano in the world as well as a diverse landscape of jagged peaks and alpine meadows. Located closer to the Oregon border than the city of San Francisco, this is one of the more difficult National Parks in California to travel to. However, just like your first trip to Yellowstone, this one will be just as memorable.

Redwood National Park works jointly with the neighboring state parks to protect the largest remaining area of Coastal Redwoods in the world. These are the tallest trees in the world, with the tallest being Hyperion which rises to an astonishing height of over 380 ft.

This is perhaps the most majestic place in California, if not the entire world. Nothing compares to the incredible Coastal Redwood trees which truly remind you of your place in nature. Although the Redwoods are the crown jewel of the park, this is also a place to discover vast praries, winding rivers, and 40 miles of rugged coastline.

![Channel Islands National Park](./channel-islands.jpg)
Channel Islands National Park is perhaps one of the most overlooked national parks in the country. Consisting of 5 out of the 8 islands that make up the Channel Islands and sitting as close as 20 miles from one of the most populous metropolitan areas in the world, this park only saw just over 400,000 visitors in 2019.

The easiest way to access the park is to take a ferry from Ventura. Most people make a day trip to the park because of the lack of services and facilities found on the islands. However, if you're feeling adventurous, this is a great place for ovevnight backcountry camping. Just be prepared, because the next boat back to the mainland won't depart till the following afternoon.

The unique landscape is a climber's paradise, with endless crags and pitches this is the perfect park for climbers of all skill levels.
