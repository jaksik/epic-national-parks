Being home to the largest sand dunes in North America and receiving less than 600,000 anual visitors, Great Sand Dunes National Park is often a hidden jem for most travelers. The dunes can be spotted from nearly 50 miles away as you head towards the park in the desolate San Louise Valley. Initial views of the dunes are not too impressive as they sit nestled at the base of some of the highest mountains in Colorado. It's not until you start approaching the park that the sheer size and mass of the dunes become mind boggling.

Great Sand Dunes National Park is a diverse ecosystem that has something to offer to just about anyone. If sledding down sand dunes isn't your thing, there are many other options from soaking in the river, to hiking to alpine lakes, and even more.

### 4. Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park

Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park is home to some of the steepest cliffs and oldest rocks in the country. with parts of the canyon reaching depths of nearly half a mile and being as narrow as only 40ft, it can be a difficult place to navigate.

Althought the canyon its self is magnificent, a visit to the park is not worth it for many travelers. The canyon walls are so steep that it doesn't offer the views that you might find at the Grand Canyon and it doesn't offer a variety of trails either for people of all skill levels.
