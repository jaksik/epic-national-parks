The best time to visit Mesa Verde National Park is in late spring or early fall, that way you can hopefully avoid any winter weather as well as large crowds. Just a short drive from Durango, the largest town in the region, Mesa Verde National Park is well worth the visit.

Being home to the largest sand dunes in North America and receiving less than 600,000 anual visitors, Great Sand Dunes National Park is often a hidden jem for most travelers. The dunes can be spotted from nearly 50 miles away as you head towards the park in the desolate San Louise Valley. Initial views of the dunes are not too impressive as they sit nestled at the base of some of the highest mountains in Colorado. It's not until you start approaching the park that the sheer size and mass of the dunes become mind boggling.

Great Sand Dunes National Park is a diverse ecosystem that has something to offer to just about anyone. If sledding down sand dunes isn't your thing, there are many other options from soaking in the river, to hiking to alpine lakes, and even more.
