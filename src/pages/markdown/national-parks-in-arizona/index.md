Arizona is home to 3 incredible national parks that truly showcase the powerful forces of nature. 

## What are the national parks in Arizona?
The national parks in Arizona are the largest cacti in the United States, a fosilised forest, and of course the largest canyon in the world, The Grand Canyon.
**These are the national parks in Arizona:**

### 1. Grand Canyon National Park

The Grand Canyon will inspire anyone from any walk of life and is with out a doubt the best place to visit in all of Arizona if not the country. Nothing compares to the sheer size of the canyon as it seems to endlessly continue into the horizon.

The south rim of the Grand Canyon is the most popular and most accessible side of the park. Located just 1.5 hours northwest of Flagstaff.

### 2. Petrified Forest National Park

Petrified Forest National Park is primarily known for the large composites of fosilised coniffer trees, known as petrified wood. The trees grew nearly 225 million years ago and have fosilized over time as minerals crystallize within the wood's cellular structure. It takes about 1 hour to drive through the park, but it's reccommended to set a side full day to experience the whole park.

Located just about 1.5 hours east of Tucson, Arizona off of I-40, access to Petrified Forest is fairly easy. It's deffinitely worth stopping at the park if your passing through the region, but if your on a limited schedule your time might be better spent at the Grand Canyon.

### 3. Saguaro National Park

Saguaro National Park is named after and known for the largest cacti in the United States in which it protects, the giant saguaro. These cacti can grow upwards of 45 feet tall and can take nearly 200 years to fully mature.

The western side of Saguaro National Park is deffinitely worth the visit if you're interested in witnessing these magnificent plants. The park is an easy 25 minute drive from Tucson, Arizona.
